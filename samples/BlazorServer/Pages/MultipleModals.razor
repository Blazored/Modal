<h1>Multiple Modals</h1>

<hr class="mb-5" />

<p>
    It is possible to show multiple modals at the same time. Each new modal needs to be shown from the currently active modal.
    In this example an initial confirmation modal is shown, if you select <em>Yes</em> then a second confirmation modal is shown.
    When you <em>Close</em> the second modal both modals will be closed. If you <em>Cancel</em> the second modal, only the second
    modal will be closed.

<button @onclick="ShowModal" class="btn btn-primary">Show Modal</button>

@code {

    [CascadingParameter] public IModalService Modal { get; set; }

    void ShowModal() => Modal.ShowAsync<YesNoPrompt>("First Modal");
}
