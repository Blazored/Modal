Blazored Modal is a powerful and customizable modal implementation for [Blazor applications](https://blazor.net).

## Getting Started

The first step is to install the Blazored.Modal NuGet package into your project. You can install the package via the nuget package manager, just search for *Blazored.Modal*. You can also install via powershell using the following command.

```powershell
Install-Package Blazored.Modal
```

Or via the dotnet CLI.

```bash
dotnet add package Blazored.Modal
```

### Register Services

Blazored Modal uses a service to coordinate modals. To register this service you need to add the following using statement and call to `AddBlazoredModal` in your applications `Program.cs` file.

```csharp
using Blazored.Modal;
```

```csharp
builder.Services.AddBlazoredModal();
```

:::info

The above code assumes the use of top level statements. If your application is not using them, please add the call to `AddBlazoredModal` where you're registering services for your app.

:::

### Add Imports

To avoid having to add using statements for Blazored Modal to lots of components in your project, it's recommended that you add the following to your root *_Imports.razor* file. This will make the following usings available to all component in that project.

```razor
@using Blazored.Modal
@using Blazored.Modal.Services
```

### Add the CascadingBlazoredModal Component

The `<CascadingBlazoredModal />` component cascades an instance of the `IModalService` to all decendant components. This should be added to the root component of your application (usually `App.razor`) wrapping the Router as per the example below.

```html
<CascadingBlazoredModal>
    <Router AppAssembly="typeof(Program).Assembly">
        ...
    </Router>
</CascadingBlazoredModal>
```

### Displaying a modal

In order to display a modal, you must define a cascading parameter on the component that will invoke the modal:

```csharp
[CascadingParameter] public IModalService Modal { get; set; } = default!;
```

Once you have the cascading parameter setup, you can call the `Show` method on the `IModalService` passing in the title for the modal and the type of the component you want the modal to display. For example, if you have a component called `Movies` that you want to display in a modal from the `Home` component on a button click.

```html
@page "/"

<h1>Hello, world!</h1>

Welcome to Blazored Modal.

<button @onclick="@(() => Modal.Show<Movies>("My Movies"))">View Movies</button>

@code {
    [CascadingParameter] public IModalService Modal { get; set; }
}
```
